Terminal-run hangman written in python!
This is my first attempt at a python project after learning the fundamentals of the language online.
The program allows 3 options for category choice (animals, colors, and country names) 3 options for difficulty (easy: 7 tries, medium: 5 tries, hard: 3 tries), validating user input for each choice
A word is randomly chosen from the .txt file corresponding to the users choice of category and the program runs until the user loses or guesses the word
